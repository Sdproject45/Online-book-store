This component secures user access and manages user sessions.

**Features**:
- **Spring Security** is implemented to handle authentication (login and registration) and authorization (access control).
- Secure login and registration processes.
- Role-based access control for users and administrators.
- Password encryption to ensure user data protection.

---

### 2. Book Management

**Purpose**:  
Manages the bookstoreâ€™s catalog, allowing administrators to oversee book listings.

**Features**:
- **CRUD Functionality**: Administrators can create, read, update, and delete book entries.
- **Search and Filtering**: Users can search for books by title, author, or category, enhancing the user experience.

---

### 3. Shopping Cart Management

**Purpose**:  
Facilitates the user's shopping experience by managing their selected items.

**Features**:
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add books to their shopping cart while browsing.
- **Cart Persistence**: The shopping cart maintains its state throughout the user session, allowing users to review their selections before checkout.

---

### 4. Checkout Process

**Purpose**:  
Streamlines the process of completing purchases.

**Features**:
- **Order Review**: Users can review their cart contents before finalizing the transaction.
- **Payment Integration**: The system integrates with payment gateways to securely process transactions.
- **Order Confirmation**: After a successful purchase, users receive confirmation along with order details.

---

### 5. Order Management

**Purpose**:  
Keeps track of user orders and their statuses.

**Features**:
- **Order History**: Users can view their past orders, including details and statuses.
- **Admin Oversight**: Administrators have tools to manage order processing, update statuses, and handle customer inquiries.

---

### 6. Admin Panel

**Purpose**:  
Provides administrators with tools to manage the bookstore operations.

**Features**:
- **User Management**: Admins can view, add, or remove user accounts and manage user roles.
- **Inventory Control**: Tools for managing book inventory, including stock levels and book details.
- **Sales Reporting**: Generate reports to analyze sales trends and inventory turnover.

---

### 7. Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: The main framework for building the application, providing rapid development capabilities.
- **Spring MVC**: Handles web requests and responses, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database interactions and data management using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **Thymeleaf**: A templating engine for rendering dynamic web pages.
- **H2 Database**: An embedded database for development and testing, allowing for easy setup and teardown.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project build automation.

## Code Snippets and Examples

This section showcases key components from the Online Book Store project, highlighting their functionality and benefits.

---

### LoginController.java

This code defines a `LoginController` in a **Spring Boot** application, responsible for managing user authentication and access control.

**Main Benefits**:
1. **User Authentication**:  
   The `showLoginPage()` method checks if the user is authenticated. If not (either `null` or an instance of `AnonymousAuthenticationToken`), it returns the login view. If authenticated, it redirects to the book page.
   
2. **Access Restriction Handling**:  
   The `showAccessDenied()` method returns an error view when access to a resource is denied, ensuring proper handling of unauthorized access.

**Summary**:  
This controller helps manage user login and handle access restrictions, making it easier to implement secure access in the application.

### BookService.java

This class handles the business logic for managing books in the online bookstore, promoting a separation of concerns and clean code design.

**Main Benefits**:
1. **CRUD Operations**:  
   Provides functions to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** book records in the system.
   
2. **Pagination Support**:  
   The `findPaginated()` method enhances user experience by retrieving books in a paginated format, particularly useful for large datasets.
   
3. **Flexible Searching**:  
   The `findByNameContaining()` method allows users to search for books by name, improving the search functionality.
   
4. **Safe Data Handling**:  
   The `findBookById()` method returns an `Optional`, which minimizes the risk of null pointer exceptions, promoting safer code practices.

**Summary**:  
The `BookService` class provides a robust framework for efficient book data management, ensuring streamlined CRUD operations, flexible searching, and safe data retrieval.
